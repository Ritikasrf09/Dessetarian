            <h4 class="about-owner">My Story</h4>

            <p class="aboutus2-dessetarian">It all started with my passion for cooking when I was a little girl. I have enjoyed cooking and baking for my
                family since I was 12 years old. I began my career in a very sterio-type manner. Taking addmissions in the
                best courses offered in Commerce field.(Yes, I am a commerce graduate.) However, I always had my mind on
                cooking -- cooking for my friends, cooking for my family. I began taking cooking courses online. My dream
                was always to be an Entrepreuner. But sometimes as its said “It’s ok to not have plan”. I planned a lot of
                things about my life,but very few turned up as per my plans. Before I moved to the Bengaluru. I made the
                decision to study further. With my family’s support, I went to study Web Development. I know you are thinking
                why from baking to IT in a zap. But as I told you before things didn’t work out my way. Hence, I took a break
                from baking and inculcated some new skills from the scratch. Worked as a full-time Developer for few years.
                After 7 years of long wait, learning, internship at professional bakeries, and planning, it was time to execute
                Dessetarian again. With the experiences at these five-star hotels, I developed a range of skills to create
                cakes with exquisite taste that have become the foundation for Cocoa Bakery.
            </p>
            <h4 class="greatful-to">In Gratitude </h4>
            <p class="aboutus3-dessetarian">Without the help and unending support of my dear sister Richa. N. Bansal, my dream would never have come true.
                His encouragement is so important to me. I would like to express my gratitude to my mother, Sarla Saraf.
                And I would like to thank you beloved father, Arun Saraf. My dearest daddy did not receive a formal education,
                but he knew the importance of education to his children. All of his life he worked hard for us. His love
                and guidance are always with me. He once said to me, “I cannot give you much, but I will support you as far
                as you want.” These words echo in my heart everyday. He is my life role model. I will never forget his love,
                his perseverance, and his positive attitude toward life.
